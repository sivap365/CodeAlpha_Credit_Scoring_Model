# CodeAlpha_Credit_Scoring_Model

# 🧾 Credit Scoring Model using Machine Learning

## 📌 Objective
This project aims to predict an individual’s **creditworthiness** using structured financial or proxy tabular data. The model performs **binary classification** to indicate whether a person is creditworthy based on features such as income, debts, and financial behavior.

Since real financial datasets are not public due to privacy, we have used the **Breast Cancer dataset** from scikit-learn as a clean, structured substitute for demonstration.
